* Fix bug in [Dialog#request](/api#dialog-request) where Promise was not being resolved properly with the received response to the outbound request.
* [Srf#proxyRequest](/api#srf-proxy-request) and [Srf#request](/api#srf-request) now return Promises when no callback provided, for consistency with other methods
