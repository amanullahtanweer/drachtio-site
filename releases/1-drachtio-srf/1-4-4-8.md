* Added support for sending periodic 'ping' requests to the server.  These are mainly useful to keep connections alive and active if they traverse network firewalls that may terminate tcp connections periodically if traffic has not been exchanged between the endpoints.  This feature is disabled by default, but can be turned on by setting `opts.enablePing` when calling Srf#connect or Srf#listen, e.g.

<pre style="margin-left: 5em; color:#D91C5C">
srf.connect({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 9022,
  secret: 'cymru',
  enablePing: true
});
</pre>

The default ping interval is 15 seconds.  You can change this by setting `opts.pingInterval` to a value of milliseconds (must be >= 5000 and <= 300000); for instance, to set the ping interval to 45 seconds:

<pre style="margin-left: 5em; color:#D91C5C">
srf.connect({
  host: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 9022,
  secret: 'cymru',
  enablePing: true,
  pingInterval: 45000
});
</pre>

The server responds with a 'pong' message (note that you do not need to do anything to handle this; it is not exposed to the application level).

This feature requires a drachtio server version of v0.8.2 or above; however, it is safe to call it against earlier versions (there just won't be any ping messages sent).
