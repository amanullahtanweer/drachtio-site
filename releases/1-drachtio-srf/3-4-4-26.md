* proxyRequestHeaders and proxyResponseHeaders now can take keyword 'all' to copy SIP headers from A to B leg without specifying them individually.  Can also then selectively remove some; e.g. `proxyRequestHeaders: ['all', '-Authorization']`.  Note that headers such as To, From, Via, Contact, Route, Record-Route are never copied.
