* Added `opts.responseHeaders` to [Srf#createB2BUA](/api#srf-create-b2bua) to provide SIP headers to include on responses to the A party.  The value may be either an object containing the SIP headers to apply on all responses to the A party (provisional as well as final), or a function returning an object that contains the SIP headers to apply.  If a function is provided, it will be called with the signature `(uacRes, headers)`, where `uacRes` is the response received from the B party, and `headers` are the SIP headers that have already been set on the response message to the A party (e.g., through the `opts.proxyResponse` option).
