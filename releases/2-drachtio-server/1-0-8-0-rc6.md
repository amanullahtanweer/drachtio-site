* bugfix: crash when requested protocol is not enabled (issue #64)
* add support for nat detection based on appearance of nat=yes in the Record-Route or Contact header (issue #66).  Some proxies are known to insert this when the detect nat scenarios.
* fix for some compile warnings.
* when choosing a transport for outbound invite, check the the protocol of the outbound proxy (if one is configured)
* include a transport= param in the Contact header in 200 OK response to incoming invite when transport is not udp (required by pjsip)
